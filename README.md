ðŸ§­ The goal of this guide is to explain every step of the process for building a Pwnagotchi device. While the overall process is not too difficult, many things can go wrong - and in my case, they did. Iâ€™ve included all the issues I faced and how I fixed them, so you can avoid the same problems.

I hope this guide is useful for anyone trying to build their own Pwnagotchi, and that it also serves as a reference for me in the future.

ðŸš€ Letâ€™s get started!
