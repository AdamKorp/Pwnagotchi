🧭 The goal of this guide is to explain every step of the process for building a Pwnagotchi device. While the overall process is not too difficult, many things can go wrong - and in my case, they did. I’ve included all the issues I faced and how I fixed them, so you can avoid the same problems.

I hope this guide is useful for anyone trying to build their own Pwnagotchi, and that it also serves as a reference for me in the future.

🚀 Let’s get started!

### 🧰 Hardware Required
To build your own Pwnagotchi, you’ll need the following components:

🖥️ E-Ink Display pHAT – 2.13" (250x122) - A low-power, black-and-white screen that displays the Pwnagotchi interface.

🍓 Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W - The small but powerful single-board computer that runs Pwnagotchi.

🔋 PiSugar 3 Battery - The battery that powers your Pwnagotchi on the go.

💾 MicroSD Card - Used to store the Pwnagotchi operating system and data.

🔌 Micro USB Cable - For charging, powering, or connecting to the Pi for setup.
